Idea Sharing Platform

Project Overview:
This is a simple idea-sharing platform where users can post, like, dislike, edit, and delete ideas. Users can also interact with ideas through comments. Authentication is handled using local storage, allowing users to register and log in. However, since it uses local storage, data is only stored on the user's device and will not sync across different devices.

Key Features:
1)User Authentication: Signup, login, and logout functionality using local storage.
2)Post Ideas: Users can share their thoughts and ideas.
3)Like/Dislike System: Users can engage with posts by liking or disliking ideas.
4)Edit & Delete: Users can only modify or remove their own ideas.
5)Comments & Replies: Users can leave comments to interact with different ideas.
6)User-Specific Content: Ideas display the username of the person who posted them.

Technologies Used:
HTML, CSS, JavaScript: Core frontend development.
Local Storage: Used to store user credentials and ideas.

Setup Instructions
1)Clone the Repository:
  git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository.git

2)Navigate to the Project Folder:
  cd your-repository

3)Open in a Browser:
  Simply open the index.html file in your browser.

Limitations
1)No Database: Data is stored locally in the browser; it does not persist across devices.
2)No Server-Side Authentication: Credentials are stored in local storage, which is not secure for real-world applications.
3)No Real-Time Updates: Users must refresh to see new content posted by others.

Future Improvements
1)Use a backend with a database (e.g., Firebase, MongoDB) for persistent storage.
2)Implement real-time updates using WebSockets or Firebase Firestore.
3)Improve security with encrypted authentication methods.
